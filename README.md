# Kiya #

<img align="right" src="kea.jpg">

Kiya is a tool to manage secrets stored in any of:

- Google Secret Manager(GSM)
- Google Bucket and encrypted by Google Key Management Service (KMS)
- Amazon Web Services Parameter Store (SSM)
- Azure Key Vault (AKV)
- File on local disc

### Introduction

Developing and deploying applications to execution environments (dev,staging,production) requires all kinds of secrets.
Both continuous development enviroment and production environment require credentials to access other resources.
Examples are passwords, service accounts, TLS certificates, API tokens and Encryption Keys. These secrets should be
managed with great care. This means secrets must be stored encrypted on reliable shared storage and its access must
controlled by AAA (authentication, authorisation and auditing).

**Kiya** is a simple tool that eases the access to the secrets stored in GSM,KMS or SSM. It requires an authenticated account and permissions for
that account to read secrets and perform encryption and decryption.

#### Labeled secrets

A secret must have a label and a plain text representation of its value. A label is typically composed of a domain or
site or application (the parent key) and a secret key, e.g. google.gmail/info@mars.planets. A label must have at least
one parent key (lowercase with or without dots). The value must be a string which has a maximum length of 64Kb.

### Prerequisites

#### GCP

Kiya uses your authenticated Google account to access the Secret Manager / Storage Bucket, KMS and Audit Logging.
The bucket stores the encrypted secret value using the label as the storage key.

	gcloud auth application-default login

#### AWS

Kiya uses your AWS credentials to access the AWS Parameter Store (part of Systems Management).
All values are stored using the specified encryption key ID or the default key set for your AWS Account.

#### AKV

Kiya uses your authenticated default credentials. Make sure you have the Azure CLI installed.
All secrets are stored with the default config provided in your vault.

    az login

#### File

When using the file backend, make sure Kiya is allowed to read and write to the provided location.
The file store is created with permission 0600

## Install

	go install github.com/kramphub/kiya/cmd/kiya@latest

## Usage

Read `setup.md` for detailed instructions how to setup the basic prerequisites.

### Configuration

Create a file name `.kiya` in your home directory with the content for a shareable secrets profile. You can have
multiple profiles for different usages. Each profile should either mention `kms`, `gsm` or `ssm` to be used as the `backend`.
If no value is defined for a profile's `backend`, `kms` will be used as a default available for GCP.
Use the backend `ssm` if you are storing keys in AWS Parameter Store as part of the System Management services.

```json
{
  "teamF1-on-kms": {
    "backend": "kms",
    "projectID": "your-gcp-project",
    "location": "global",
    "keyring": "your-kiya-secrets-keyring",
    "cryptoKey": "your-kiya-secrets-cryptokey",
    "bucket": "your-kiya-secrets"
  },
  "teamF2-on-gsm": {
    "backend": "gsm",
    "projectID": "another-gcp-project"
  },
  "teamF3-on-file": {
    "backend": "file",
    "projectID": "my-file-name"
  },
  "teamF4-on-akv": {
    "backend": "akv",
    "vaultUrl": "https://<vault-name>.vault.azure.net"
  },
  "teamF5-on-ssm": {
    "backend": "ssm",
    "location": "eu-central-1"
  }
}

```

#### GCP

You should define `location`, `keyring`, `cryptoKey` and `bucket` for KMS based profiles.
For Google Secret Manager based profiles a `projectID` is sufficient.

#### AWS

You should define `location` for SSM (AWS Systems Management) based profiles ; its value is an AWS region.
The `cryptoKey` is optional and must be set if you do not want to use the default key setup for your AWS Account.

#### AKV

You should define the `vaultUrl` for AKV (Azure Key Vault) based profiles ; its value is the URI used to identify a vault on Azure.

#### File

You should define `projectID` as it is used as a prefix for the file name.
Optionally, you could provide `location` in order to store the file at a location of your choosing.

If no `location` is provided, $HOME/<projectID.secrets.kiya will be used.

When retrieving a password using **put** or **get**, provide the -pw my-master-password flag

Storing or remembering the master password is the responsibility of the user.
You can use different master passwords for different keys.

For the best security, it is best not to store your master password on the same device as your store.

### Store a password, _put_

	kiya teamF1 put concourse/cd-pipeline mySecretPassword

In this example, `teamF1` refers to the profile in your configuration. `concourse` refers to the site or
domain. `cd-pipeline` is the username which can be an email address too. `mySecretPassword` is the plain text password.

If a password was already stored then you will be warned about overwriting it. The -quiet flag can be used to skip the
confirmation prompt:

	kiya -quiet teamF1 put concourse/cd-pipeline myNewSecretPassword

_Note: this will put a secret in your command history; better use paste, see below._

_Note2: when using a file based backend, provide the -pw my-master-password flag_

### Generate a password, _generate_

	kiya teamF1 generate concourse/cd-pipeline 25

Generate a secret with length 25 store it as secret `concourse/cd-pipeline` and copy its value to the OS clipboard.

### Retrieve a password, _get_

	kiya teamF1 get concourse/cd-pipeline

_Note: this will put a secret in your command history; better use copy, see below._

_Note2: when using a file based backend, provide the -pw my-master-password flag_

### List labels of stored secrets, _list_

	kiya teamF1 list [|filter]

Specifying a filter argument will hide any keys that don't contain the filter string.

The list command is also used when the command is unknown, e.g. `kiya teamF1 list redbull` shows the same results
as `kiya teamF1 redbull`.

### Fill a template, _template_

    kiya teamF1 template template-file

Output will be written to stdout.

Example contents of `template-file`:

    bitbucket-password={{kiya "key-to-bitbucket-password"}}

Kiya also provides a builtin function for base64 encoding:

    artifatory-hashed-password={{base64 (kiya "key-to-artifatory-password")}}

For accessing OS environment values:

    gcp-project={{env "PROJECT"}}

### Write a secret to clipboard, _copy_

    kiya teamF1 copy concourse/cd-pipeline

### Create secret from clipboard, _paste_

    kiya teamF1 paste google/accounts/someone@gmail.com

### Move a secret from one profile to another, _move_

    kiya teamF1 move bitbucket.org/johndoe teamF2

### Analyse all secrets by checking their strength (entropy)

```shell
kiya teamF2 analyse
```

## Backup

 - You can create encrypted and unencrypted backups of your secrets.
 - Store the public key in the same store or file system
 - You can filter with `backup` command 

   

| Arg                          | Type   | Description                                                  |
| ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--encrypt-backup`           | bool   | *Default: **false*** if `true`, the backup will be encrypted and you need to specify the path to the public key using the `--backup-key` parameter |
| `--backup-key-store`         | string | *Default: **file*** `file` - when your public key is stored on the file system or `store` - when your public key is stored in one of the cloud providers. |
| `--backup-key`               | string | *Default: **./kiya_backupkey_rsa*** path to public key       |
| `--backup-path`              | string | *Default: **./kiya_backup*** path to backlup                 |
| `--backup-restore-overwrite` | bool   | *Default: **false*** by default kiya will not override your keys, pass `true` at your own risk :) |
|                              |        |                                                              |

### Backup without encryption

Backup all keys without encryption:

```shell
kiya teamF1 backup
```

or with params:

```shell
kiya --backup-path /nasdrive/backup/mybackup teamF1 backup "/my_keys/"
```
in this example the kiya backup only the keys containing `/my_keys/` and saves the backup to `/nasdrive/backup/mybackup`.


### Backup with encryption

```shell
kiya --backup-path /nasdrive/backup/mybackup --encrypt-backup --backup-key "./path/to/public_key"  teamF! backup
```

...when the public key is stored in a vault:

```shell
kiya --backup-path /nasdrive/backup/mybackup --encrypt-backup --backup-key-store "store" --backup-key "/path/to/public_key"  teamF! backup
```

### Restore non-encrypted backup

```shell
kiya --backup-path /nasdrive/backup/mybackup teamF1 restore
```

### Restore encrypted backup

```shell
kiya --backup-path /nasdrive/backup/mybackup --backup-key ./secure/path/backup_key ag5 restore
```

### Generate public/private key pair

```shell
kiya teamF1 keygen ./path/to/key/location
```
after executing this command you will get the result:

```shell
Key './path/to/key/location', './path/to/key/location_pub' saved
Public key copied to clipboard
```
The public key has been copied to the clipboard, but you must put the private key in a safe place (
e.g. print it out on paper and put it in a physical safe :)).

#### Auto copy to clipboard

The `list` (which is the default command if no command is given) command will show a table of matches based on the given command line argument. If that list contains a single match and your profile has `autoCopyEnabled` set to true then the secret will be copied to the clipboard automatically.

### Prompt for command by line number

The `list` (which is the default command if no command is given) command will show a table of matches based on the given command line argument. If your profile has `promptForSecretLine` set to true then each line has a number and the tool will prompt for the number to execute the line.

### Limitations

- In this version, the private key can only be retrieved from the file system 
- The public key can now only be stored in the same profile

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Error

	2017/06/24 22:14:24 google: could not find default credentials. See https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/application-default-credentials for more information.
